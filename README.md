## Introduction

This is a collection of demos as a Streamlit app showcasing the capabilities of custom-trained HGR models on freely available SDKs and frameworks for various HGR tasks. Select a model configuration from the sidebar to try out the different models and tasks.
Have fun exploring!

## Features

- Support for Images🖼️, Videos🎞️, and Webcam📷 Photos and Video Streams
- Custom YOLOv8 detection model for hand detection task (HGR)
- Custom YOLOv8 classification model for hand classification task (HGR)
- Custom MediaPipe hand gesture recognition task (HGR)
